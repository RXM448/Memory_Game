# Memory_Game
A small memory game where the player reveals images by clicking on tiles 

The game creates a 3 * 4 grid of buttons all with the same "cover" image, then secretly assigns each of 6 images to two random buttons. When a button is clicked it reveals the assigned image, when a two buttons have been clicked the game checks to see if they are assigned to the same image, if so the buttons remain showing the assigned image, if not they return to the cover image and in either case the process repeats untill all images are revealed.
